# Introduction to CCR & Linux Servers

## Overview
This course is an introduction to Linux system and how to utilize skills and tools to work efficiently in the command line interface (CLI) there. In particular, the computer cluster service provided by the Center for Computation Research ([CCR](http://www.buffalo.edu/ccr.html)) is based on Linux, so another goal of this course is to teach how to build a convenient and personalized workflow in that environment.

## Contents
There are two parts of this course. The first two sessions teach the basics, which includes a short introduction to Linux system and CLI; common commands, tools and tricks; the CCR computation cluster; how to manage projects, test and submit jobs in the server; sync between server and local machine. The last two sessions introduce advanced skills and tools, including writing bash scripts; managing files with midnight commander; monitoring system with htop; multitasking with tmux; and using vim as coding IDE.
